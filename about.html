            Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while
            maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner or a turn.
            The technique causes the rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the
            front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left,
            wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering). Drifting is
            traditionally performed using three methods: clutch kicking (where the clutch is rapidly disengaged
            and re-engaged with the intention of upsetting the grip of the rear wheels), weight transfer (using
            techniques such as the Scandinavian flick), and employing a handbrake turn. <br><br>This sense of drift is
            not to be confused with the four wheel drift, a classic cornering technique established in Grand Prix and
            sports car racing.[citation needed]
            As a motoring discipline, drifting competitions were first popularized in Japan in the 1970s and further
            popularized by the 1995 manga series Initial D.
            Drifting competitions are held worldwide and are judged according to the speed, angle, showmanship, and line
            taken through a corner or set of corners.<br><br>
            Drift cars are usually light- to moderate-weight rear-wheel-drive coupes and sedans, offering a large range
            of power levels. There have also been all-wheel drive cars that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such
            as the Subaru WRX, Toyota Avensis, Scion tC, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Dodge Charger, and Nissan GT-R.
            Early on, AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, and usually the rules
            allowed only a certain percentage of power to be sent to the front wheels, but they are banned in most (if
            not all) drifting competitions today.
