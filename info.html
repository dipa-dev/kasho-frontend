      <h2>1. What does drifting mean?</h2>
      <img src="image_hover\image copy 3.png" alt="Drifting car">
      <p>Drifting is all about controlling the slide — a technique where the car’s rear tires lose traction but the driver maintains full control around a corner. Drifting is a sport that focuses on a particular driving technique of the same name, which has been used in other well-known motorsports, such as rally and speedway racing, for numerous years. Car drifting is all about using oversteer to get the vehicle to drive sideways through corners. This has to happen at a high speed and while the driver remains in full control of the car.</p>

      <h2>3. Which cars are best for drifting?</h2>
      <p>Cars with rear-wheel drive, balanced weight, and easy mod potential. Think: Nissan 240SX, Mazda RX-7, Toyota AE86, BMW E36. Theoretically, every single car is capable of drifting. However, cars that are equipped with rear-wheel drive are particularly good at this technique. A four-wheel drive can also make a good drift car. Ideally, the car should have manual gears for the driver to exploit its full potential. The only way to do this is by having complete control of both gears and the clutch.</p>

      <h2>4. Drift history: when did it start?</h2>
      <p>Born in Japan’s mountain passes in the '70s, drifting went global thanks to legends like Keiichi Tsuchiya and the rise of drift culture.
        Drifting can be traced back to the 1980s. However, it's been known as a driving technique used in other motorsports since the 1950s. Drifting as a unique racing discipline started in Japan with Kunimitsu Takahashi, who is widely considered the 'father of drifting'. Takahashi, a former motorcycle racer who even competed in Formula 1 in 1977, made a name for himself in Japanese touring car racing, where he became known for his distinctive driving style.

        <h2 class="tagline">Drifting: Precision in madness, where tires scream and adrenaline sings.

          Would you like it to sound more poetic, aggressive, or playful?.</h2>
      </section>
      <p>At a time when most racing drivers feared severe oversteer in their cars, Takahashi took advantage of his car's behaviour to drift through corners at a high speed, earning him a number of titles along the way.
        However, drifting is mostly associated with the name Keiichi Tsuchiya, also known as the 'Drift King', who adopted the style from his role model in the Japanese Touring Car Championship. First and foremost, to inspire the audience. He became known through the 'Plupsy' videos published in 1987, in which he used his Toyota Corolla Levin to drift on public roads, thereby causing serious hype in Japan.</p>
      
      <p>It took a while before the wave of drift enthusiasm moved from the east to the west. It wasn't until the mid-1990s, 1996 to be precise, that the first drift event outside of Japan took place at Willow Springs Raceway in California, USA.
        The first world championship in drifting was the Red Bull Drifting World Championship, held in 2008. It took place in Long Beach, California, and found its first champion in New Zealand's Rhys Millen.</p>

      <h2>5. What does a drift race track look like?</h2>
      <p>Curvy, technical layouts with tight corners and long sweepers — designed to test control and style, not just top speed.In contrast to classic circuit races, where the tracks are several kilometres long, the distances for drift tracks are much shorter. Usually only a few hundred meters long, the drift race track consists of as many curves as possible lined up next to each other.
        The straight sections in between allow the cars to pick up speed in order to slide through the upcoming corners at the highest possible speed and with a high drift angle.</p>
      <img src="https://img.redbull.com/images/w_3000/q_auto,f_auto/redbullcom/2022/4/25/p2vhxxtj2iy9dba4qntz/drifting-track" alt="Drift track">

      <h2> 6. Which tyres are best for drifting?</h2>
      <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/74/2e/1e/742e1e3a6dc72fe2c1283f288209c6ea.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Drifting requires more than just a few sets of tyres, as the technique quickly wears the rubber down. To get started with drifting, you can buy relatively cheap, run-in rear tyres and invest a bit more in the front tyres, as they are crucial for grip, traction and control in corners.
        For the front tyres, professionals usually use ones with good grip or even slicks – tyres that have no profile. In addition, the tyre pressure has a big impact and greatly depends on the specific vehicle, as well as personal preferences.</p>

    <div class="topic">
      <h2>7. How are drift races scored?</h2>
      <p>Judges look for speed, angle, line, and flair. In tandem runs, how well the chase car mimics the lead car matters big time.
        Unlike other motorsport disciplines, neither lap, stage times nor placement on the track plays a role in the overall score. But how do you even go about rating a car that is drifting sideways through corners?
For this particular purpose, the so-called judges are used when drifting. You will typically find three of them present at an event. They evaluate both the qualifying and final runs of a drift event based on four core criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <span class="highlight"> speed and fluidity:</span> the faster and more fluid a drift runs, the more points you get.</li>
        <br><li><span class="highlight">The drift angle:</span> the larger the angle, the more points there are. A good instinct is required here because there are hardly any points if the angle is too low. If the angle is too high, the car may slow down.</li>
          <br><li><span class="highlight">The line:</span> Before any event, the judges inform the drivers about the ideal line. Certain points have to be approached on the track, sometimes with the front, sometimes with the rear. The more precisely you are able to stick to this line, the higher the score.</li>
          <br><li><span class="highlight">The style: </span>The most important criteria when drifting. How precisely is the drift initiated? Do you have to make corrections often? Do you drive a lot at full throttle? All of this goes into the fourth score.
          </li>
         
      </ul>
      <p>In the so-called twin battles, the supreme discipline of drift sports, two drivers are on the same track at the same time. Two laps are driven, in each of which one vehicle is in the lead (leader) and the other one behind (chaser).
        In twin battles, the evaluation is based on the four criteria mentioned above, in which the leader should score as many points as possible. An additional proximity rating is added for the pursuer. Here the judges make sure that you stay as close as possible to the person in front without touching them.</p>

      <h2>8. Can you drift on public roads?</h2>
      <p>Nope. It’s dangerous and illegal. Drift on closed tracks where you can go wild safely and legally.</p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
      <h2>9. Can you learn how to drift?</h2>
      <p>Yes! Start small in safe areas or join a drift school. Learn throttle control, steering, and balance step by step.In numerous countries, you will find dedicated tracks for drifting. Here you can familiarise yourself with the basics or level up if you already have the fundamentals in place.
        Discussing what makes a good drift racer, veteran racer Johannes Hountondji says: "Good coordination helps, as does a certain level of basic fitness and a healthy level of responsiveness. You can train all of that."</p>

    <div class="topic">
      <h2>10. Drift games: virtual training at home</h2>
      <p>Simulators like Assetto Corsa, CarX Drift Racing, and Forza give you a real feel for drifting physics — without burning tires.Besides the real-life race tracks, there are also virtual drifting games that present a realistic simulation of what it feels like to drive a drift car. "In order to initiate a drift, you have to go just over the limits of the car. You have to get used to that - simulations help with that," reveals Johannes Hountondji.
        Excellent options include games such as DRIFT21, Assetto Corsa, GRID Legends or CarX Drift Racing Online.</p>
